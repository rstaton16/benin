            <p>Ouidah is known for the main role she played in the slave trade during the 
            17th, 18th and 19th centuries, when almost a million people were embarked on 
            ships and, from the beach of Ouidah, transported through Atlantic. Originally, 
            however, Ouidah (formerly Glewé) was a small village in a small kingdom of Xweda.
            Its inhabitants lived on agriculture, hunting and fishing in the coastal
            lagoons - far from the dangers of the sea and tides.</p>
            <p> The first contact between Ouidah and the Europeans took place during the
            sixteenth century. Although the slave trade along the Bay of Benin began immediately
            after, it was not until the end of the seventeenth century that European merchants 
            began to buy slaves in the kingdom of Xweda on a large scale, establishing forts 
            And counters in the town of Glewé. This trade ensured prosperity to the kingdom 
            until the moment of its military invasion in 1727 by the kingdom of Dahomey:
            its citizens were killed, captured and dispersed, and trade with the Europeans 
            passed over to the hands of the Dahomeans.</p>
